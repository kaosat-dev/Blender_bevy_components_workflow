# Basic save_load example/demo

This example showcases how to use ```bevy_save_load``` crate to save & load your bevy game

## Notes Workflow with blender / demo information

- the gltf files for this demo where generated using the **Export dynamic and static objects seperatly** feature of the blenvy addon:
so the static & dynamic level files where generated automatically, based on the entities that have a **Dynamic** component/custom property 


## Running this example

```
cargo run --features bevy/dynamic_linking
```
